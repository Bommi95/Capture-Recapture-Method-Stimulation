# Capture-Recapture-Method-Stimulation

  Mark and recapture is a method commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size where it is impractical to count every individual. 
 In its simplest form, n1 individuals are “captured,” “tagged”, and released. A while later, n2 individuals are “captured” and the number of “tagged” individuals, m2, is counted. If N is the true total population size, we can estimate it with NˆLP as follows:
NˆLP = n1*n2 /m2
This is called the Lincoln-Peterson estimator1
